Secure account management for Ethereum Classic.

[NOTE]
====
An offline wallet, also known as cold storage, provides the highest level of security for savings.
It involves storing a wallet in a secured place that is not connected to the network (air-gapped).
When done properly, it can offer a very good protection against computer vulnerabilities.
====

Distributed as a command line tool (CLI), as a Rust crate or can be embedded via foreign function interface (FFI).
